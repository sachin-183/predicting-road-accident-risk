# Predicting Road Accident Risk

##  My Participation
I participated the Kaggle competition and developed the **`predicting-road-accident-risk.ipynb`** notebook as my solution.  
The notebook includes:
- Full **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
- **Feature Engineering** for categorical and numerical variables
- **Model Training** using machine learning algorithms
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Prediction Generation** for the Kaggle submission file  

My focus was on achieving a balance between **model accuracy** and **generalization** on unseen data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset using **Pandas**
- Handled missing or inconsistent values
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Encoded categorical variables using **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding**
- Scaled numerical values with **StandardScaler**
- Created interaction and polynomial features for better model expressiveness

### 3. Model Building
Tested and compared multiple models, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **LightGBM Regressor**

The best-performing model was selected based on **cross-validation RMSE**.

### 4. Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R¬≤ Score**

### 5. Submission
- Generated predictions for the test set  
- Created a `submission.csv` file following Kaggle‚Äôs format

## üìä Results & Insights
- The model achieved solid predictive performance with optimized parameters.
- Key influential factors on accident risk:
  - Road curvature and speed limit  
  - Weather and lighting conditions  
  - Time of day and number of lanes  
- Feature importance analysis showed that **environmental and design factors** play a crucial role in road safety.
